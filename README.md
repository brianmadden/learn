# Learn

This repository contains sample datasets and a set of exercises to help you learn the basics of Malloy.

The best starting point is the use github.dev, Github's browser-based VSCode experience. When in this repository, simply press the period key `.` on your keyboard. This will open up github.dev, and from there, you can install the VSCode extension and start to browse any of the `malloynb` files.

- `malloy_cardio.malloynb`: a set of exercises to walk you through much of Malloy's critical functionality
- `faa.malloynb`, `ga_sample.malloynb`, `auto_recalls.malloynb`: model scaffolding to serve as a jumping-off point if you want to continue using Malloy on different datasets.
