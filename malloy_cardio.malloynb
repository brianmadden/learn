## Step 0: Get Ready

The first step in any Malloy data modeling exercise is to declare your sources. In the following code cell, declare a source for each of the tables in the ecommerce dataset. Refer to the [documentation for the precise syntax](https://malloydata.github.io/documentation/language/source).
>>>malloy
// users table at data/users.parquet
source: users is duckdb.table('data/ecommerce/users.parquet')

// Create a source for the rest of the tables in this dataset:

// products
source: products is duckdb.table('data/ecommerce/products.parquet')

// inventory_items
source: inventory_items is duckdb.table('data/ecommerce/inventory_items.parquet')

// orders
source: orders is duckdb.table('data/ecommerce/orders.parquet')
